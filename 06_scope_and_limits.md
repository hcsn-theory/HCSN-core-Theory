# Layer VI — Scope, Limits, and Falsifiability  
*(What HCSN Claims — and What It Explicitly Does Not)*

This document defines the **domain of validity**, **interpretive limits**, and **falsifiability conditions** of the Hypergraph Causal Structure Network (HCSN).

No physical theory is complete without saying where it *stops*.

---

## 1. Scope of the Theory

HCSN is a **pre-geometric, pre-quantum, causal theory**.

It addresses:

- the origin of spacetime
- the emergence of relativistic causality
- the appearance of particles as stable defects
- the emergence of quantum-like correlations
- the arrow of time
- universality of physical law

HCSN operates **below** the level of:
- fields
- wavefunctions
- manifolds
- metrics
- Hilbert spaces

These structures are *derived*, not assumed.

---

## 2. What HCSN Is *Not*

HCSN is **not**:

- a modification of General Relativity  
- a hidden-variable theory in Bell’s sense  
- a lattice field theory  
- a quantum gravity model in the conventional sense  
- a replacement for the Standard Model (yet)

It does **not** introduce:
- new particles
- adjustable constants to fit experiments
- extra dimensions
- anthropic assumptions

---

## 3. Limits of Current Formalization

### 3.1 Lack of Closed-Form Continuum Action

HCSN currently does **not** provide:

- a unique Lagrangian
- a fundamental action functional
- exact analytic solutions in the continuum

This is expected.

The theory is **computational-first**, not variational-first.

---

### 3.2 Effective, Not Exact, Lorentz Invariance

Lorentz symmetry in HCSN is:

- emergent
- statistical
- scale-dependent

At sufficiently small causal scales:
- Lorentz invariance breaks
- dispersion deviates
- anisotropies appear

This is a **feature**, not a flaw.

---

### 3.3 Quantum Mechanics Is Recovered Only Operationally

HCSN reproduces:

- nonlocal correlations
- interference-like behavior
- measurement irreversibility

But it does **not** postulate:

- a universal wavefunction
- collapse axioms
- Born rule as fundamental

Probability is emergent from topology and coarse-graining.

---

## 4. Interpretation Constraints

### 4.1 No Ontological Spacetime

Spacetime is **not real** at the fundamental level in HCSN.

Only causal relations exist.

Any interpretation that treats spacetime as fundamental is incompatible.

---

### 4.2 No Fundamental Observers

Observers do not play a privileged role.

Measurement is:
- causal truncation
- topological projection
- irreversible information loss

There is no observer-induced collapse.

---

## 5. Relationship to Existing Theories

### 5.1 General Relativity

- recovered as a hydrodynamic limit
- curvature ↔ causal density gradients
- Einstein equations are effective, not fundamental

---

### 5.2 Quantum Mechanics

- entanglement ↔ shared causal ancestry
- superposition ↔ unresolved causal structure
- decoherence ↔ topological separation

---

### 5.3 Thermodynamics

- entropy ↔ rewrite multiplicity
- arrow of time ↔ causal depth growth
- equilibrium ↔ rewrite saturation

---

## 6. Falsifiability

HCSN is falsifiable.

### 6.1 Empirical Failure Conditions

The theory is ruled out if:

- no universal causal speed limit emerges
- macroscopic Lorentz symmetry fails generically
- long-lived defects cannot form
- universality across micro-dynamics is absent
- correlations require explicit nonlocal rules

---

### 6.2 Predictive Signatures

HCSN predicts:

- Lorentz violations at ultra-short scales
- discrete dispersion relations
- topology-dependent correlation decay
- universality classes of physics, not unique micro-laws

---

## 7. Open Problems (Explicit)

The following are **known open problems**, not hidden gaps:

1. Exact derivation of Einstein equations
2. Precise recovery of the Born rule
3. Classification of all stable defect types
4. Coupling multiple defect species
5. Renormalization group flow in causal space
6. Experimental probes of causal discreteness

These are *research directions*, not inconsistencies.

---

## 8. Why HCSN Is Conservative (Despite Appearance)

Although radical in ontology, HCSN is conservative in method:

- minimal assumptions
- locality preserved
- causality enforced
- symmetry emergent, not imposed

It explains *why* physics looks the way it does, rather than replacing it.

---

## 9. Final Boundary Statement

> HCSN does not claim to be the final theory of nature.  
> It claims to explain **why any effective theory is possible at all**.

---

## End of Core Theory

This completes the foundational HCSN theory stack.

Further work belongs to:
- extensions
- phenomenology
- simulations
- experimental interface

But the core logic is closed.
