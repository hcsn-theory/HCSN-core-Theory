## Effective Degrees of Freedom

At large scales, the microscopic rewrite dynamics coarse-grain into:

- A scalar causal order parameter Ω(x, t)
- Defect excitations acting as localized sources
- A causal background enforcing finite signal speed

## Dynamical Regimes

### 1. Diffusive Regime (Generic)
- Dominant at small scales or high noise
- Perturbations decay as ⟨x²⟩ ∝ t
- No coherent propagation

### 2. Weakly Propagating Regime
- Appears when local stability and inertia are present
- Finite-speed fronts form
- Mixed wave–diffusion behavior

### 3. Ballistic / Wave-like Regime (Non-generic)
- Requires effective second-order time response
- Requires approximate local conservation
- Produces light-cone–like propagation
