## Effective Equation of Motion

At coarse scales, Ω(x,t) satisfies an effective second-order equation:

∂²_t Ω = c² ∇² Ω − m² Ω − γ ∂_t Ω + ξ(x,t)

where:
- c is the emergent causal speed
- m is an effective mass scale
- γ is a damping coefficient
- ξ represents stochastic residuals

### Interpretation

- The ∂²_t term enables wave-like propagation
- The m² term explains finite correlation length
- The γ term explains relaxation and diffusion
- The finite c enforces a causal cone
