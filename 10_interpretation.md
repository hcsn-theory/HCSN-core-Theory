## Emergent Lorentzian Structure

The existence of a finite invariant speed c
and a second-order causal equation
implies an emergent Lorentzian causal structure.

No microscopic boost symmetry is assumed.
Lorentz symmetry is approximate and effective,
not fundamental.

### What is Emergent

- Light-cone structure
- Finite propagation speed
- Causal ordering

### What is NOT Assumed

- Exact Lorentz invariance
- Fundamental spacetime metric
- Continuum geometry

## What the Effective Theory Does Not Claim

- Ω is not spacetime curvature
- Ω is not quantum probability amplitude
- The effective equation is not exact
- Lorentz invariance is not fundamental
