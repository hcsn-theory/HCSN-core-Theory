# Physical Correspondence

This layer explains why known physics appears without being postulated.

## Finite Signal Speed

Local rewriting implies finite influence propagation.
This produces causal cones.

## Lorentz Symmetry

No preferred frame exists at the fundamental level.
Lorentz invariance emerges as a universality class.

## Energy & Momentum

- Momentum arises from directional persistence of defects
- Energy arises from resistance to topological change

## Mass

Mass corresponds to defect inertia:
how difficult a structure is to rewrite.

## Quantum Behavior

- Non-deterministic rewrites produce probabilistic outcomes
- Interference arises from competing causal histories

## Entanglement

Correlations arise from shared causal ancestry.
No superluminal signaling is required.

# Layer IV — Physical Correspondence  
*(Why Known Physics Appears)*

This layer explains why familiar physical laws arise as effective descriptions of HCSN dynamics.

No physical law is assumed.
All correspondence is emergent and approximate.

## 1. Correspondence Principle (HCSN)

A physical theory corresponds to HCSN if its equations describe stable coarse-grained statistics of causal rewrites.

> Continuum physics is an effective language, not fundamental truth.

---

## 2. Special Relativity

### 2.1 Finite Signal Speed

Local rewrites imply a universal upper bound:

\[
\frac{\Delta d_C}{\Delta T} \le v_{\max}
\]

This produces:
- causal cones
- forbidden superluminal influence
- observer-independent maximum speed

No metric was postulated.

---

### 2.2 Lorentz Invariance as an Attractor

At large scales, coarse-grained dynamics minimize anisotropy.

Result:
- approximate Lorentz symmetry
- universality across parameter variations

Lorentz invariance is **emergent**, not exact.

---

## 3. Relativistic Energy–Momentum Relation

Defect statistics satisfy:

\[
E^2 \approx (p v_{\max})^2 + (m v_{\max}^2)^2
\]

Where:
- \( p \): causal drift rate
- \( m \): inverse mean lifetime
- \( E \): resistance to annihilation

This reproduces the relativistic dispersion relation.

---

## 4. Quantum Mechanics

### 4.1 Superposition

Multiple rewrite paths coexist until coarse-grained averaging.

Quantum states correspond to **ensembles of histories**, not vectors.

---

### 4.2 Interference

Interference arises from:
- path overlap
- causal redundancy
- nontrivial topology

No wavefunction is fundamental.

---

### 4.3 Entanglement

Entanglement corresponds to overlapping causal supports.

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{graph}} \neq \text{Distance}_{\text{emergent space}}
\]

This reproduces Bell-like correlations **without nonlocality**.

---

### 4.4 Measurement

Measurement is **topological decoherence**:
- overlap destroyed
- correlations lost
- classical records formed

No collapse postulate exists.

---

## 5. Gauge Fields

### 5.1 Emergence of Fields

The Ω field acts as an effective scalar gauge background.

Gauge bosons arise as:
- propagating Ω excitations
- stable mode decompositions

---

### 5.2 Local Symmetry

Gauge invariance reflects **rewriting redundancy**, not symmetry of space.

---

## 6. General Relativity

### 6.1 Geometry from Causality

Curvature corresponds to:
- variations in causal density
- distortion of causal cones

Spacetime geometry is a statistical description.

---

### 6.2 Einstein Equation (Effective)

At large scales:

\[
\text{Causal curvature} \sim \langle \text{defect energy} \rangle
\]

Einstein’s equations arise as hydrodynamic limits.

---

## 7. Classical Physics

Classical mechanics emerges when:
- Ω is large
- fluctuations average out
- defect lifetimes are long

Determinism is an illusion of scale.

---

## 8. Thermodynamics

Entropy corresponds to:
- rewrite multiplicity
- causal branching count

Arrow of time is growth of causal depth.

---

## 9. What Is Exact vs Approximate

| Law | Status |
|----|----|
Causality | Exact |
Locality | Exact |
Finite speed | Exact |
Lorentz invariance | Approximate |
Quantum mechanics | Approximate |
General relativity | Approximate |
Continuum spacetime | Approximate |

---

## 10. Where HCSN Differs from Known Physics

- No fundamental spacetime
- No fundamental fields
- No Hilbert space
- No exact Lorentz symmetry
- No true singularities

---

## 11. Testable Deviations

HCSN predicts:
- small Lorentz violations at extreme scales
- mass–lifetime correlations
- breakdown of continuum near causal granularity
- topology-dependent entanglement limits

---

### The Ω ≈ Ωc regime corresponds to a dynamically protected geometric vacuum 

## Summary

> Known physics is not wrong.
> It is incomplete.
>
> HCSN explains *why it works* — and *where it fails*.
