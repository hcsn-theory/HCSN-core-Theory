# Proto-Particles in HCSN (Revised)
**Status:** Empirically Supported Emergence  
**Scope:** Assumptions → Axioms → Theorems transition  
**Basis:** Forced-probe simulations, ξ-cluster tracking, Ω-confinement dynamics  

---

## 1. Purpose and Methodological Shift

This document supersedes the original *Proto-Particles in HCSN* hypothesis file.

The purpose is to **document the transition** from:
- speculative assumptions  
to  
- empirically constrained axioms and theorems  

based strictly on **simulation evidence**, not interpretation.

No claim is made about correspondence to physical particles.

---

## 2. Original Assumptions: Status Update

### A1 — Localization Mechanism  
> Proto-particles correspond to localized bound configurations of ξ and Ω.

**Status:** ✅ *Confirmed (with refinement)*  

**What changed:**  
Localization is not caused by ξ alone, nor by Ω alone.

**Empirical result:**  
Localization emerges from **Ω-gradient confinement + ξ surface tension + cluster memory**.

**Revised statement:**  
> Localization is an emergent consequence of competing rewrite acceptance pressures, not a primitive mechanism.

---

### A2 — Persistence Criterion  
> A proto-particle must persist across many rewrite steps.

**Status:** ✅ *Confirmed*  

**Evidence:**  
Clusters persist for **thousands of rewrite steps**, far exceeding noise lifetimes.

Persistence is **phase-dependent** and collapses outside critical regimes.

---

### A3 — Identity Through Rewrite  
> Identity is defined by overlap continuity, not vertex identity.

**Status:** ✅ *Confirmed and strengthened*  

**Evidence:**  
Clusters survive massive vertex turnover while retaining continuity.

Identity is **purely relational** and history-dependent.

This is now elevated to an axiom (see §4).

---

### A4 — Interaction Capability  
> Proto-particles must influence one another when proximate.

**Status:** ⚠ *Partially confirmed, under refinement*  

**What failed:**  
Initial expectation of spontaneous interaction without protection was incorrect.

**What emerged instead:**  
- Proto-particles **merge by default**
- Repulsion requires **post-nucleation protection**
- Interaction exists but is **highly phase- and history-dependent**

Interaction is real but **not generic**.

---

## 3. New Assumptions Discovered During Development

These were **not hypothesized initially**, but were forced by failures.

---

### N1 — Cluster Memory Is Required  
> Without historical memory of ξ–ξ adjacency, proto-particles dissolve or overgrow.

Cluster adjacency memory is now considered **structural**, not optional.

---

### N2 — Nucleation Protection Is Necessary  
> Newly formed clusters require temporary repulsion to survive long enough to stabilize.

Without this, all proto-particles collapse into a single condensate.

---

### N3 — Mass Is Not Size  
> Large clusters are not more stable by default.

Stability depends on:
- Ω confinement
- surface exposure
- fragmentation penalties  

This invalidates naïve size-based particle definitions.

---

## 4. Axioms (Promoted from Assumptions)

These statements have held across **all tested runs**.

---

### **Axiom 1 — Relational Identity**
A proto-object is defined by **continuity of overlap**, not by constituent identity.

There exists no persistent “particle core”.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Phase Dependence**
Proto-particles exist **only** in restricted Ω regimes.

They are not universal features of the rewrite system.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Emergent Mass Analogue**
Resistance to deformation, diffusion, and fragmentation emerges from
Ω confinement and ξ surface tension.

Mass is **dynamical**, not intrinsic.

---

## 5. Formal Definitions (Updated)

### Definition 1 — ξ-Active Vertex
Unchanged.

---

### Definition 2 — ξ-Cluster
Unchanged, but **cluster identity is time-indexed**.

---

### Definition 3 — Cluster Continuity (Operational)
Two clusters are identical iff continuity holds over **multiple steps**, not just one.

Single-step overlap is insufficient.

---

### Definition 4 — Proto-Particle (Revised)

A proto-particle is a ξ-cluster satisfying:

1. **Bounded growth** over long time windows  
2. **Long-lived continuity** (≫ noise lifetime)  
3. **Resistance to fragmentation**  
4. **Ω-dependent existence**  
5. **History dependence**

---

### Definition 5 — Proto-Particle Lifetime
Unchanged.

---

### Definition 6 — Proto-Particle Interaction (Revised)

Two proto-particles interact if proximity induces:

- altered survival probability  
- Ω redistribution  
- ξ deformation  
- merger, deflection, or exclusion  

Interaction **need not be symmetric**.

---

## 6. Empirical Theorems

These statements summarize repeatable outcomes.

---

### **Theorem 1 — Spontaneous Proto-Particle Formation**
Under forced probe conditions, ξ-clusters satisfying proto-particle criteria
emerge without explicit construction.

---

### **Theorem 2 — Proto-Particle Stability Is Dynamical**
Stability arises from acceptance-probability balance, not fixed constraints.

Removing any major penalty term destroys stability.

---

### **Theorem 3 — Proto-Particle Count Is Not Conserved**
Proto-particles can:
- merge
- annihilate
- be born  
without violating any conservation law.

---

### **Theorem 4 — Detection Depends on Definition**
Different detection criteria yield different particle counts.

Proto-particles are **observer-relative objects** within the theory.

---

## 7. Observable Quantities (Confirmed)

The following are now **validated observables**:

- Lifetime distributions  
- Mean ξ per cluster  
- Mean Ω per cluster  
- Cluster size variance  
- Birth and death times  
- Inter-cluster distance (graph-based)

---

## 8. Revised Failure Conditions

The proto-particle program fails if:

- stability requires hard-coded identity  
- clusters survive in all Ω regimes  
- interaction never alters trajectories  
- detection depends on arbitrary tuning only  

None of these failures have occurred so far.

---

## 9. Status Summary

- Proto-particles **exist** as emergent, relational, phase-dependent structures.
- They are **not fundamental**, not conserved, and not universal.
- Their behavior is governed by **competition**, not symmetry.

The theory has progressed from:
> “Do proto-particles exist?”  
to  
> “What kinds of interactions and effective laws do they obey?”

---

## 10. Forward Directions

Next documentation phase may include:

- Effective force laws (distance vs response)
- Scattering experiments
- Interaction classification
- Stability phase diagrams

Only after those may any analogy to known physics be responsibly explored.
