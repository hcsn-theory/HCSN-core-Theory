# Proto-Particle Interaction in HCSN
**Status:** Empirically Supported (Simulation-Based)
**Scope:** Interaction principles only

---

## 1. Motivation

Initial proto-particle hypotheses assumed that interactions would arise via:
- Ω gradients
- ξ transport forces
- field-mediated coupling

All such mechanisms have been **empirically falsified**.

This document formalizes the **actual interaction mechanism observed** in HCSN simulations.

---

## 2. Negative Results (Established)

The following interaction models do **not** occur:

- ❌ ξ–ξ force exchange
- ❌ Ω-gradient attraction or repulsion
- ❌ Action–reaction symmetry
- ❌ Local geometric force laws
- ❌ Momentum-like transfer

These failures are stable across parameter scans.

## 3. Core Discovery: Rewrite Competition Interaction (RCI)

### Principle 1 — Rewrite Scarcity

> Rewrite events are a finite resource locally constrained by Ω-regime and graph structure.

---

### Principle 2 — Competitive Suppression

> Coexisting ξ-clusters suppress one another’s rewrite opportunities.

This suppression is asymmetric.

---

### Principle 3 — Environment Mediation

> Interactions are mediated by the Ω-regime, not by direct inter-cluster coupling.

The environment absorbs imbalance.

---

## 4. Formal Definition — Rewrite Competition Interaction

Let:
- \( R_A(t) \): set of rewrites touching cluster A
- \( R_B(t) \): set of rewrites touching cluster B

### Rewrite Overlap Distance
\[
d_{AB} = 1 - \frac{|R_A \cap R_B|}{|R_A \cup R_B|}
\]

This replaces geometric distance.

---

### Interaction Strength
\[
F_{AB} = \frac{|\Delta \xi_A - \Delta \xi_B|}{\tau}
\]

Where \( \tau \) is coexistence time.

---

## 5. Empirical Laws (Current)

1. **Non-zero interaction occurs iff rewrite overlap exists**
2. **Interaction strength decreases with rewrite-distance**
3. **Action–reaction symmetry is violated**
4. **Total ξ is not conserved**
5. **Ω mediates dissipation**

---

## 6. Interpretation

Proto-particles are **rewrite competitors**, not force carriers.

They resemble:
- ecological species
- autocatalytic structures
- entropic sinks

More than:
- classical particles
- quantum fields

---

## 7. Ontological Shift

| Classical Physics | HCSN |
|------------------|------|
| Force | Rewrite suppression |
| Distance | Rewrite overlap |
| Interaction | Competition |
| Field | Ω-regime |
| Conservation | Statistical only |

---

## 8. What This Is *Not*

- Not gravity
- Not electromagnetism
- Not quantum exchange
- Not spacetime curvature

These may emerge later.

---

## 9. Next Steps

1. Test monotonicity of \( F_{AB}(d_{AB}) \)
2. Measure interaction range
3. Test many-body competition
4. Identify conserved statistical quantities
5. Investigate confinement and screening

---

## 10. Status Summary

Interaction **exists**, but not as force.

HCSN proto-particles interact via **rewrite competition**.

This is a new primitive.
