A1: Local rewrites only
A2: No future dependence
A3: Statistical conservation
A4: Geometry is emergent


Axiom A1 — Locality
All rewrite rules act on finite hypergraph neighborhoods.
Axiom A2 — Causal Consistency
No rewrite may depend on future rewrites.
Axiom A3 — Soft Conservation
Global charges are conserved statistically, not exactly.
Axiom A4 — Computation First
Geometry, time, and matter are reconstructed, never primitive.
