# Topological Defects as Particles in HCSN

## Definition

A topological defect in HCSN is defined as a localized, temporally persistent
violation of hierarchical closure continuity: |ΔΩ| > ε
These events are not imposed but detected observationally during rewrite dynamics.

---

## Localization Without Space

Defects are localized not in space, but in:

- causal time
- rewrite support
- worldline overlap

Localization is therefore relational and operational.

---

## Persistence and Worldlines

A defect is said to persist if successive defect events share a significant
fraction of rewrite support.

This induces a worldline: Defect(t₁) → Defect(t₂) → ...
Worldlines are emergent and require no embedding space.

## Particle Interpretation

A defect qualifies as a particle if it satisfies:

1. Persistence over time
2. Finite lifetime
3. Measurable momentum
4. Stable species classification

All four criteria are empirically satisfied in simulation.

## Absence of Wavefunctions

No wavefunction, Hilbert space, or state vector is used.

Particles are defined purely by:
- rewrite statistics
- causal persistence
- observable responses

This aligns with observable-first formulations of physics.
