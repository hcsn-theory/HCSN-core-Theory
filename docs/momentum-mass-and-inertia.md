# Momentum, Mass, and Inertia in HCSN

## Momentum (Observational)

Momentum is defined as an imbalance in rewrite activity around a defect: p = (# after) − (# before)
measured within a finite temporal window.

No vectors, coordinates, or reference frames are assumed.

---

## Acceleration

Acceleration is defined discretely: a = p(t + Δt) − p(t)
This defines inertial response without forces.

---

## Mass

Mass is defined as resistance to momentum fluctuation: m ∝ 1 / Var(p)
This is empirically supported by simulation:
- long-lived defects have low Var(p)
- short-lived defects have high Var(p)

---

## Interpretation

Mass emerges as a *statistical stiffness* of rewrite flow.

This reproduces the role of inertial mass without invoking:
- continuous spacetime
- Lagrangians
- symmetry postulates

---

## Implications

- Inertia is emergent
- Mass is measurable
- Momentum conservation is approximate but statistically robust

This constitutes a fully relational mechanics.
