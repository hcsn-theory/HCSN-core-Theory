# Proto-Particles in HCSN  
**Status:** Hypothesis & Active Investigation  
**Scope:** Formal assumptions, definitions, and test criteria only  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formalizes the **proto-particle hypothesis** within the HCSN framework.

A *proto-particle* is **not** assumed to be a physical particle, quantum excitation, or field mode.  
It is a **candidate emergent structure** arising solely from rewrite dynamics, hierarchical closure (Ω), and the transport field ξ.

All statements here are **provisional** and subject to falsification by simulation.

---

## 2. Background (Current State Only)

The following components are already established:

- Rewrite dynamics on a causal hypergraph
- Hierarchical closure parameter Ω and its phase structure
- Transport field ξ exhibiting phase-dependent propagation

What is **not yet established**:

- Stable matter-like entities
- Quantum numbers
- Linear (QM-like) regime
- Relational geometry
- GR or QFT limits

This document addresses **only the next step**: proto-particles.

---

## 3. Working Assumptions (Explicitly Falsifiable)

### Assumption A1 — Localization Mechanism
> Proto-particles correspond to **localized bound configurations of ξ and Ω**, where ξ does not diffuse globally but remains confined due to local Ω structure.

If ξ spreads indefinitely or collapses universally, this assumption is false.

---

### Assumption A2 — Persistence Criterion
> A proto-particle must persist across many rewrite steps despite background fluctuations.

Transient ξ spikes do **not** qualify.

---

### Assumption A3 — Identity Through Rewrite
> Proto-particles are identified by **overlap continuity**, not by fixed vertex identity.

Identity is defined relationally, not ontologically.

---

### Assumption A4 — Interaction Capability
> Proto-particles must influence one another when brought into proximity, producing measurable deviations from independent evolution.

Non-interacting clusters are not particles.

---

## 4. Formal Definitions

All definitions below use **only internal HCSN quantities**.

---

### Definition 1 — ξ-Active Vertex

A vertex \( v \) is **ξ-active** at time \( t \) if:

\[
\xi(v, t) \ge \xi_0
\]

where \( \xi_0 \) is a fixed detection threshold.

---

### Definition 2 — ξ-Cluster

At time \( t \), a **ξ-cluster** \( C(t) \) is a **connected subgraph** of ξ-active vertices.

Connectivity is defined via the interaction graph.

---

### Definition 3 — Cluster Continuity

Two clusters \( C(t) \) and \( C(t+1) \) are identified as the *same object* if:

\[
\frac{|C(t) \cap C(t+1)|}{|C(t) \cup C(t+1)|} \ge \alpha
\]

where \( \alpha \in (0,1) \) is a continuity threshold.

---

### Definition 4 — Proto-Particle

A **proto-particle** is a ξ-cluster satisfying:

1. **Localization:**  
   \( |C(t)| \) remains bounded over time

2. **Persistence:**  
   The cluster survives for \( \Delta t \gg 1 \)

3. **Stability:**  
   Fluctuations in size and mean ξ remain bounded

4. **Phase Dependence:**  
   Existence depends on Ω regime

---

### Definition 5 — Proto-Particle Lifetime

The **lifetime** of a proto-particle is the number of rewrite steps over which continuity holds.

---

### Definition 6 — Proto-Particle Interaction

Two proto-particles are said to **interact** if their proximity leads to:

- altered lifetimes
- deformation
- fusion
- annihilation
- trajectory deflection (in interaction graph distance)

---

## 5. Observable Quantities

For each detected proto-particle, the following are recorded:

- Cluster size \( |C| \)
- Mean ξ: \( \langle \xi \rangle \)
- Mean Ω: \( \langle \Omega \rangle \)
- Lifetime \( \tau \)
- Interaction outcomes

These form the **proto-particle catalog**.

---

## 6. Phase Expectations (Hypotheses)

| Ω Regime | Expected Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| Subcritical | No persistent clusters |
| Critical | Marginal, transient proto-particles |
| Supercritical | Stable, interacting proto-particles |

These expectations are **not guaranteed** and serve only as test targets.

---

## 7. Failure Conditions

The proto-particle hypothesis is **rejected** if:

- No long-lived ξ-clusters exist
- All clusters decay exponentially
- Clusters show no interaction effects
- Behavior is Ω-independent

Negative results are scientifically valid outcomes.

---

## 8. Next Validation Steps

1. Implement ξ-cluster detection
2. Measure lifetime distributions
3. Perform controlled dual-injection experiments
4. Quantify interaction statistics
5. Revise assumptions based on results

Only after successful validation may the theory proceed to:

- quantum numbers
- linear regime
- relativistic backreaction

---

## 9. Status Summary

This document defines **what must be true** for proto-particles to exist.

It does **not** claim they do.

The theory advances only if these assumptions survive empirical testing.
