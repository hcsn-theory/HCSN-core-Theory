# Universality and Emergent Spacetime in HCSN

This document summarizes the key evidence that **HCSN (Hierarchical Causal Structure Network)** exhibits *universal emergent physics*, independent of microscopic rewrite details.

The results below demonstrate that causal structure, effective field dynamics, and particle-like excitations arise as **attractors**, not assumptions.

## 1. Universality Table (Step 21)

The following table compares independent simulation variants.  
Each variant modifies microscopic rewrite parameters while preserving the same high-level structure.

| Variant    | Max Causal Speed (vₘₐₓ) | c² (Effective) | m² (Effective) | Lorentz Violations | Mean Particle Lifetime |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| baseline   | 1.0                      | 1.0233        | 0.00634       | 0                  | 17.8                   |
| variant_1  | 1.0                      | 1.0233        | 0.00634       | 0                  | 17.2                   |
| variant_2  | 1.0                      | 1.0233        | 0.00634       | 0                  | 17.2                   |
| variant_3  | 1.0                      | 1.0233        | 0.00634       | 0                  | 28.5                   |
| variant_4  | 0.5                      | 1.0233        | 0.00634       | 0                  | 11.8                   |

### Interpretation

- The **effective equation of motion** (c², m²) is invariant across variants.
- No superluminal violations occur in any run.
- Variant_4 rescales the effective clock speed but **does not change the law**, indicating scale covariance.
- Particle lifetimes vary, but the **dynamical universality class remains unchanged**.

This is direct evidence that emergent spacetime behavior in HCSN is **robust under microscopic perturbations**.

## 2. Emergent Lorentz (Causal) Cone

### Plot: Signal Speed vs. Causal Time Separation

**What is plotted**
- **x-axis**: causal time separation Δt
- **y-axis**: inferred signal speed v = influence / Δt

**Observed structure**
- A dense cloud of subluminal points
- A sharp upper envelope at vₘₐₓ
- No points exceeding the envelope

**Measured result**
- Maximum causal speed: `vₘₐₓ ≈ 1.0`
- Total violations: `0`
- Negative correlation between speed and separation (cone structure)

### Why this matters

- No metric was predefined
- No speed limit was imposed
- No relativistic equations were inserted

Yet a **hard causal speed limit emerges**.

This is the discrete analogue of discovering that **Lorentz invariance is not postulated — it is selected**.

## 3. Schematic: From Defects to Fields

Below is a conceptual schematic of how spacetime and particles emerge in HCSN.

Local Rewrite Events │ ▼ Topological Defects (non-closure events) │ ▼ Persistent Worldlines (defect tracking) │ ▼ Ω Field (Hierarchical Closure) (coarse-grained order parameter) │ ▼ Effective Spacetime Dynamics (wave-like, causal, Lorentzian)
### Key idea

- **Particles** are not fundamental objects  
- They are **stable topological excitations**
- Fields arise from **statistical structure of histories**
- Geometry is reconstructed from **causal depth and interaction flow**

## 4. Summary Statement

> HCSN demonstrates that causal structure, effective field dynamics, and particle-like excitations emerge universally from local hypergraph rewrite rules.  
> Lorentzian spacetime behavior appears as a large-scale attractor, not a microscopic assumption.

This completes the transition from *simulation* to *theory-backed evidence*.
