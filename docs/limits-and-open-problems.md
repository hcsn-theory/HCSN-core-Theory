# Limits and Open Problems in HCSN

## Known Limitations

- Dimensional fixed points are not yet analytically derived
- Defect interactions are statistical, not exact
- Long-time scaling requires further simulation

---

## Open Questions

1. What selects effective dimensionality?
2. Can gauge-like structures emerge?
3. Are defect species stable under coarse-graining?
4. Can fermionic statistics be recovered?

## Research Direction

HCSN is not a finished theory.
It is a generative framework whose predictions are testable and falsifiable.

Its strength lies in its minimal assumptions.
