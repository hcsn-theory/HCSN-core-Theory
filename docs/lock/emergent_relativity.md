# Emergent Relativity from Causal Dynamics

## Observed Phenomenon

Simulations show:
- a sharp upper bound on signal speed,
- zero superluminal violations,
- invariant causal cones across parameter variants.

---

## Interpretation

Lorentz symmetry is not postulated.
It arises as a statistical fixed point of rewrite dynamics.

---

## Effective Interval

An effective spacetime interval may be reconstructed:

\[
ds^2 = c^2 d\tau^2 - d\ell^2
\]

This relation is emergent and approximate,
valid only in the large-scale limit.

## Claim Boundary

HCSN does not assume Special Relativity.
It explains why relativistic behavior is generic in causal systems.
