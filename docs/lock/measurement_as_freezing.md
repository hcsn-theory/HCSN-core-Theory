# Measurement as Causal Freezing

## Standard View (Rejected)

Measurement is postulated as a non-unitary collapse.

---

## HCSN Interpretation

Measurement corresponds to:
- irreversible causal locking,
- loss of alternative rewrite continuations,
- topological stabilization of a defect.

---

## Mechanism

When a defect couples strongly to a macroscopic closure hierarchy:
- rewrite freedom collapses,
- future histories become constrained,
- Ω fluctuations damp out.

---

## Result

A single outcome appears — not because alternatives vanish,
but because they are no longer causally accessible.

---

## Connection to Simulation

Observed Ω relaxation and post-defect stabilization
directly demonstrate this locking behavior.
