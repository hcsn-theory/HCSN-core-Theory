# Quantum States as Ensembles of Causal Histories

## Standard View (Rejected)

In conventional quantum mechanics, a system is described by a wavefunction:
\[
\psi(x,t)
\]

This object is postulated, not derived.

---

## HCSN View

In HCSN, there is no wavefunction.

A “quantum state” corresponds to:
> an equivalence class of rewrite histories
that are indistinguishable under coarse observation.

---

## Mathematical Interpretation

Let \( \mathcal{H} \) be the set of all rewrite histories compatible with constraints.

A quantum state corresponds to:
\[
[\mathcal{H}] = \{ h_i \mid \mathcal{O}(h_i) = \text{constant} \}
\]

where \( \mathcal{O} \) is the observable resolution limit.

## Consequence

Superposition is not physical.
It reflects *epistemic compression* over unresolved causal detail.
