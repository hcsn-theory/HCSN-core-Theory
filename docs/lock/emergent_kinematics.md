# Emergent Kinematics in HCSN

## Motion Without Position

In HCSN, there is no fundamental notion of position.
Instead, motion is defined via causal propagation through rewrite histories.

---

## Time

Time corresponds to rewrite depth, not an external parameter.
Different regions may experience different effective temporal flow.

---

## Velocity

Effective velocity is defined as:
\[
v = \frac{\Delta \ell_{\text{causal}}}{\Delta \tau}
\]
where \( \ell_{\text{causal}} \) is causal distance and \( \tau \) is rewrite depth.

---

## Key Result

A universal upper bound on \( v \) emerges dynamically,
despite no speed limit being imposed.
