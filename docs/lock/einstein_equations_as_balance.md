# Einstein Equations as Causal Balance Laws

## Standard Form

\[
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
\]

---

## HCSN Interpretation

This equation expresses balance between:
- geometric compression (left),
- causal obstruction by defects (right).

## Proposed Mapping

\[
\text{Causal curvature} \sim \nabla (\text{rewrite density})
\]

\[
\text{Energy-momentum} \sim \text{defect persistence}
\]

## Claim

Einstein’s equations are not fundamental laws,
but equilibrium conditions of causal flow.
