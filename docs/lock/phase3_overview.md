# Phase III: Emergent Quantum Behavior in HCSN

## Objective

Phase III investigates whether phenomena traditionally labeled “quantum”
can emerge from purely classical, local, causal rewrite dynamics.

No quantum axioms are assumed.
In particular, the theory does NOT assume:
- wavefunctions,
- Hilbert spaces,
- operators,
- Born rule,
- superposition as a primitive.

---

## Strategy

We replace the standard quantum ontology with:
- topological defects as particles,
- causal worldlines as histories,
- collective observables (Ω) as effective fields,
- statistics over rewrite histories as probability.

Quantum behavior is expected to emerge as a **coarse-grained description**
of unresolved causal structure.

## Core Claim

Quantum mechanics is not fundamental.
It is a *compressed description* of deep causal dynamics.
