# Gauge Symmetry as Rewrite Redundancy

## Standard View (Reinterpreted)

Gauge symmetry is often treated as a fundamental symmetry.

---

## HCSN View

Gauge symmetry arises because:
multiple rewrite histories map to the same observable outcome.

This redundancy is not physical symmetry —
it is descriptive non-uniqueness.

---

## Formal Statement

Let two rewrite histories h₁ and h₂ satisfy:
\[
\mathcal{O}(h₁) = \mathcal{O}(h₂)
\]

Then they are gauge-equivalent.

---

## Consequence

Gauge transformations do not change reality.
They relabel causal histories.
