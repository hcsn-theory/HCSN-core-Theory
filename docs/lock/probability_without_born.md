# Probability Without the Born Rule

## Standard View (Rejected)

Quantum mechanics postulates:
\[
P = |\psi|^2
\]

This rule has no causal derivation.

---

## HCSN Replacement

Probability arises from:
- relative frequency of rewrite histories,
- stability under perturbations,
- attractor structure of causal evolution.

---

## Definition

Let \( \mathcal{N}(A) \) be the number of histories consistent with outcome \( A \).

Then:
\[
P(A) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{\mathcal{N}(A)}{\sum_B \mathcal{N}(B)}
\]

---

## Interpretation

Probability is not fundamental randomness.
It reflects *combinatorial dominance* in causal space.

---

## Simulation Connection

Observed defect statistics and Ω fluctuations already follow
frequency-based distributions without imposing probabilistic rules.
