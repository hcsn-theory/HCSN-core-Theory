# Interference Without Waves

## The Puzzle

Quantum interference appears wave-like,
yet particles are detected discretely.

---

## HCSN Mechanism

Interference arises when:
- multiple causal pathways exist,
- rewrite histories overlap in interaction space,
- closure constraints amplify or suppress paths.

---

## Key Insight

No object interferes with itself.
Instead:
> histories interfere through shared causal support.

---

## Observable Consequence

Constructive and destructive interference correspond to:
- reinforcement or cancellation of closure pathways,
- not phase oscillations of a wavefunction.

---

## Prediction

Interference patterns should degrade when
topological overlap is suppressed — even without decoherence.
