# Phase V: Emergent Gravity in HCSN

## Objective

Phase V derives spacetime geometry from causal structure.

Spacetime is not fundamental.
It is an effective description of causal depth and density.

---

## Central Hypothesis

Curvature arises from:
local variation in rewrite density and causal compression.
