# Phase IV: Emergent Quantum Field Theory in HCSN

## Objective

Phase IV reconstructs the structure of quantum field theory
from causal-topological dynamics alone.

Fields are not fundamental objects.
They are emergent statistical descriptions of collective rewrite behavior.

## Core Identifications

| Standard QFT | HCSN Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Particle    | Stable defect class |
| Field       | Collective excitation of Ω-like observables |
| Interaction | Rewrite-channel coupling |
| Coupling constant | Topological overlap strength |
| Vacuum      | Defect-free rewrite equilibrium |

## Key Claim

Quantum fields do not live on spacetime.
They live on causal networks.
