# Black Holes as Rewrite Saturation

## HCSN Picture

A black hole corresponds to:
- extreme rewrite density,
- causal trapping of histories,
- saturation of closure constraints.

## Event Horizon

An event horizon is not a geometric surface.
It is the boundary beyond which rewrite continuation
cannot influence external observables.

## Information

Information is never destroyed.
It is causally trapped.
