# Phase VI: Experimental Signatures of HCSN

## Objective

Identify predictions where HCSN differs
from standard quantum mechanics and general relativity.

If no such differences exist, the theory is metaphysics.

# Where HCSN Deviates from Standard Physics

## Predicted Deviations

1. Slight dispersion near causal speed limit
2. Entanglement decay with topology disruption
3. Modified interference under causal pruning
4. Non-universal vacuum fluctuations

---

## Key Point

These deviations are small —
but measurable in principle.

# Falsifiable Tests for HCSN

## Simulation-Level Tests (Immediate)

- Vary rewrite rules → check universality
- Inject topology noise → test entanglement decay
- Suppress causal loops → break interference

---

## Physical Tests (Long-Term)

- Tabletop quantum networks
- Photonic lattice experiments
- Cold atom causal simulators

---

## Failure Conditions

The theory fails if:
- no universal speed emerges,
- correlations violate causal bounds,
- geometry does not emerge at scale.
