# Emergent Fields and Classical Dynamics

## The Ω Field

Ω behaves as a collective excitation of hierarchical closure.
It propagates causally and exhibits wave-like and diffusive regimes.

## Effective Equation of Motion

Empirical fits yield an effective equation:

\[
\partial_t^2 \Omega = c_\Omega^2 \nabla^2 \Omega - m_\Omega^2 \Omega + \dots
\]

This resembles a Klein–Gordon-type equation,
without being assumed.

## Interpretation

- \( c_\Omega \): emergent causal propagation speed
- \( m_\Omega \): defect persistence scale

---

## Important Limitation

This equation is effective, not fundamental.
Its validity is scale-dependent.
