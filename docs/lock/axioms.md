# Axioms of the Hierarchical Causal Structure Network (HCSN)

## Overview

The Hierarchical Causal Structure Network (HCSN) is a pre-geometric theory in which
physical law emerges from local computational rewrites on a hypergraph.
No spacetime manifold, metric, or quantum postulates are assumed a priori.

This document states the minimal axioms of the theory.
All subsequent results must follow from these axioms alone.

## Axiom I — Local Rewrite Dynamics

The universe is described by a finite hypergraph \( H = (V, E) \).
Evolution proceeds via local rewrite rules:

\[
\mathcal{R}_i : H \rightarrow H
\]

Each rewrite modifies only a bounded subgraph.
No rewrite may reference global properties.

---

## Axiom II — Causal Consistency

Each rewrite induces a partial causal order on events.
If rewrite \( A \) is required for rewrite \( B \), then:

\[
A \prec B
\]

The resulting structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Global time is not fundamental.

## Axiom III — No Background Geometry

No spacetime, metric, dimension, or coordinate system is assumed.
Any geometric quantity must be reconstructed from causal relations alone.

---

## Axiom IV — Observability via Histories

All observable quantities are functionals of rewrite histories and their induced
interaction graphs.

No observable may depend on unexecuted or counterfactual rewrites.

---

## Axiom V — Statistical Typicality (Emergent)

Macroscopic regularities arise from statistical properties of large ensembles
of rewrite histories.
No symmetry is fundamental; all symmetries are emergent.

---

## Minimality Claim

Removing any axiom above prevents:
- the emergence of a causal arrow of time,
- the appearance of invariant signal speeds,
- or the existence of stable defect structures.
