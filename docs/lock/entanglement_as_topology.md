# Entanglement as Topological Identification

## Standard View (Problematic)

Entanglement appears non-local and instantaneous.

---

## HCSN Resolution

Entanglement corresponds to:
> distinct defects sharing overlapping causal support.

They are distant in reconstructed geometry,
but adjacent in causal topology.

---

## Key Point

No signal propagates faster than the causal speed limit.
Correlation is explained by shared origin, not transmission.

---

## Bell-Type Correlations

Violations of Bell inequalities are expected when:
- hidden variables are causal-topological,
- not geometric or local in reconstructed spacetime.

---

## Simulation Status

Current Step 14 results show partial decay.
Stronger topology tracking is expected to recover stable correlations.
