# Spin Without Spinors

## The Problem

Spin appears intrinsically quantum and relativistic.

---

## HCSN Resolution

Spin corresponds to:
- cyclic causal structure,
- non-contractible rewrite loops,
- orientation-sensitive defect motion.

---

## Interpretation

Spin-½ behavior arises when:
a defect requires two full causal cycles
to return to an equivalent configuration.

---

## Prediction

Spin is topological, not algebraic.
