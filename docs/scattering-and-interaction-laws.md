# Scattering and Interaction Laws in HCSN

## Motivation

If defects behave as particles, their interactions must obey conservation laws.

HCSN tests this without assuming symmetry or force mediation.

---

## Scattering Experiment

Two defects are considered interacting if their rewrite supports overlap
within a finite temporal window.

Momentum is measured before and after interaction.

---

## Empirical Result

Simulations show: p₁(before) + p₂(before) ≈ p₁(after) + p₂(after)
within statistical error.

Randomized controls do not exhibit this behavior.

---

## Interpretation

Momentum conservation emerges without:
- translation symmetry
- Noether’s theorem
- background spacetime

Conservation is a *statistical consequence of rewrite locality*.

---

## Interaction Without Forces

There are:
- no force carriers
- no fields
- no potentials

Interaction is defined as correlated rewrite reorganization.

This suggests a fundamentally relational interaction mechanism.
