# Emergent Dynamics and Momentum in HCSN

## Status
**Derived from rewrite dynamics and simulation evidence**  
No external notions of force, spacetime, or conservation laws are assumed.

---

## 1. Motivation

With **worldlines** established as persistent chains of topological defects, the next question is unavoidable:

> How do worldlines *move*, *interact*, and *exchange influence*?

In conventional physics, this is answered by momentum, force, and energy.  
In HCSN, none of these concepts exist a priori.

This document shows how **dynamics and momentum emerge** from rewrite flow alone.

---

## 2. Dynamics Without Spacetime

### Definition 2.1 — Rewrite Flow

Rewrite flow is the ordered sequence of hypergraph rewrites:
\[
H_0 \rightarrow H_1 \rightarrow H_2 \rightarrow \dots
\]

Dynamics in HCSN means **how structures persist and change under rewrite flow**.

There is no background space in which anything moves.

---

## 3. Local Rewrite Asymmetry

### Definition 3.1 — Rewrite Imbalance

A region of the hypergraph exhibits a **rewrite imbalance** if:
- rewrites occur more frequently on one side of a defect worldline than the other,
- the imbalance persists over multiple steps.

Rewrite imbalance is directly observable in simulation.

---

## 4. Emergent Momentum

### Definition 4.1 — Effective Momentum

Define **effective momentum** \( \vec{p} \) of a worldline as:
\[
\vec{p} \sim \langle \nabla R \rangle
\]

where:
- \( R \) is rewrite density,
- the gradient is taken across the defect’s support.

Momentum is therefore:
- not a vector in space,
- but a directional bias in rewrite flow.

---

## 5. Direction Without Coordinates

### Observational Law 5.1 — Directionality from Causality

Simulation shows that:
- defects preferentially reappear where rewrites are denser,
- this preference defines a consistent “forward” direction.

Direction is defined **relationally**, not geometrically.

---

## 6. Momentum Conservation (Emergent)

### Observational Law 6.1 — Rewrite Conservation

Total rewrite activity is conserved globally:
- rewrites do not vanish,
- they redistribute.

When two worldlines interact:
- rewrite imbalance shifts between them,
- net imbalance is conserved.

This appears as **momentum conservation**.

No symmetry is assumed — it is forced by rewrite accounting.

---

## 7. Interaction as Momentum Exchange

### Definition 7.1 — Interaction Event

An interaction occurs when:
- two worldlines approach in causal proximity,
- their rewrite gradients overlap,
- defect charge variance spikes.

Observed outcomes:
- deflection,
- annihilation,
- fusion.

All correspond to redistribution of rewrite flow.

---

## 8. Acceleration Without Force

### Definition 8.1 — Effective Acceleration

Acceleration corresponds to **change in rewrite imbalance**:
\[
\vec{a} \sim \frac{d}{dt} \langle \nabla R \rangle
\]

No force field exists.  
Acceleration is a bookkeeping effect of changing rewrite statistics.

---

## 9. Mass as Resistance to Rewrite Flow

### Observational Law 9.1 — Mass–Persistence Relation

Worldlines that:
- are more stable under coarse-graining,
- have lower defect charge variance,

exhibit:
- smaller changes in rewrite imbalance,
- slower response to interactions.

This suggests:
\[
m \sim \frac{1}{\text{rewrite susceptibility}}
\]

Mass is emergent inertia.

---

## 10. Energy as Rewrite Activity

### Definition 10.1 — Effective Energy

Define effective energy \( E \) as:
\[
E \sim \int R \, dt
\]

where \( R \) is rewrite rate within a worldline’s support.

Higher rewrite activity corresponds to higher energy states.

---

## 11. Relation Between Energy and Momentum

### Observational Law 11.1 — Dispersion Relation

Simulation data suggests:
- persistent worldlines satisfy a relation between rewrite density and propagation rate,
- unstable defects violate this relation and decay.

This is an emergent **dispersion law**, not imposed kinematics.

---

## 12. Coarse-Graining Stability

### Observational Law 12.1 — Scale-Invariant Dynamics

Under coarse-graining:
- rewrite imbalance smooths,
- momentum remains well-defined,
- interactions preserve global balance.

This supports renormalization consistency.

---

## 13. Noether Without Symmetry

### Insight 13.1

In HCSN:
- conservation laws do not arise from symmetry,
- symmetry arises *because* conservation is forced.

Rewrite conservation precedes spacetime invariance.

---

## 14. Conjectures (Explicit)

> **Conjecture 14.1**  
Stable worldlines with conserved rewrite imbalance correspond to free particles.

> **Conjecture 14.2**  
Interaction vertices define scattering amplitudes.

> **Conjecture 14.3**  
Quantum uncertainty arises from rewrite stochasticity.

All are testable in simulation.

---

## 15. What Has Been Achieved

You now have:

- motion without space,
- momentum without vectors,
- energy without Hamiltonians,
- interactions without forces.

All derived from rewrite dynamics alone.
