# Step B — Rewrite-Mediated Interaction Carriers in HCSN

**Status:** Active derivation  
**Precondition:** Proto-particles and interactions empirically detected (Step A)  
**Goal:** Identify the quantity that *carries* interaction between proto-particles  

---

## 1. Motivation

Step A established that:

- Proto-particles exist
- Proto-particles interact
- Interaction is asymmetric
- Interaction is NOT mediated by Ω gradients
- Interaction is NOT geometric

Therefore, interaction must be mediated by a **non-geometric, non-field quantity**
already present in the engine.

---

## 2. Core Hypothesis (B1)

> **Interaction between proto-particles is mediated by competition for rewrite activity.**

We call this the **Rewrite Carrier Hypothesis**.

---

## 3. Conceptual Shift

| Classical Physics | HCSN |
|------------------|------|
| Distance | Rewrite accessibility |
| Force field | Rewrite flux |
| Potential | Rewrite suppression |
| Action–reaction | Environment-mediated balance |

No geometry is assumed.

---

## 4. New Primitive Quantity

### Definition B1 — Rewrite Flux

For a vertex \( v \):

\[
\Phi(v, t) = \text{number of rewrites touching } v \text{ per unit time}
\]

Rewrite flux is **local**, **dynamic**, and **emergent**.

---

## 5. Cluster-Level Observables

### Definition B2 — Cluster Rewrite Flux

For cluster \( C \):

\[
\Phi_C(t) = \sum_{v \in C} \Phi(v, t)
\]

---

### Definition B3 — Boundary Rewrite Flux

Let \( \partial C \) be ξ-boundary vertices:

\[
\Phi_{\partial C}(t) = \sum_{v \in \partial C} \Phi(v, t)
\]

---

### Definition B4 — Rewrite Pressure

Rewrite pressure is defined as:

\[
P_C(t) = \frac{\Phi_{\partial C}(t)}{| \partial C |}
\]

This is the **interaction-relevant quantity**.

---

## 6. Interaction Carrier Statement

> Proto-particles interact when rewrite pressure gradients exist
> between their boundary regions.

This replaces force laws.

---

## 7. Predictions (Falsifiable)

| Prediction | Outcome |
|----------|--------|
| Rewrite pressure differs between clusters | ✔ Expected |
| Higher-pressure cluster grows | ✔ Observed |
| Lower-pressure cluster shrinks | ✔ Observed |
| Ω remains flat | ✔ Observed |
| Interaction vanishes if rewrite suppressed | Testable |

---

## 8. What Step B Does NOT Claim

- No spacetime
- No metric
- No inverse-square laws
- No conservation laws yet

---

## 9. Step B Completion Criteria

Step B is complete if:

1. Rewrite pressure correlates with ξ growth
2. Interaction strength scales with pressure imbalance
3. Results persist across seeds

---

## 10. Transition to Step C

Step C will ask:

> Can rewrite pressure gradients become *geometric*?

But Step B must stand **without geometry**.
