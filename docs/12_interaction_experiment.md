# Proto-Particle Interaction Experiment (HCSN)

**Status:** Empirical test  
**Prerequisite:** Verified proto-particle existence  

---

## 1. Objective

To determine whether proto-particles exhibit **interaction effects** when brought into proximity.

Interaction is defined operationally as **statistical deviation from independent evolution**.

---

## 2. Experimental Setup

Two proto-particles are injected sequentially into the same HCSN universe:

1. First proto-particle is nucleated at critical Ω
2. System is stabilized
3. Second proto-particle is nucleated at a controlled distance
4. System evolves freely

No external forces or constraints are applied.

---

## 3. Distance Definition

Proto-particle distance is defined as:

\[
d(C_1, C_2) = \min_{v \in C_1, u \in C_2} d_{\text{interaction}}(v, u)
\]

where distance is measured in the interaction graph.

---

## 4. Measured Observables

At each rewrite step:

- Number of ξ-clusters
- Cluster sizes
- Interaction-graph distance
- Merge / annihilation events
- Lifetime modulation

---

## 5. Interaction Criteria

Proto-particles are said to **interact** if proximity produces:

- increased merger probability
- reduced lifetime
- deformation of ξ or Ω profile
- exclusion / repulsion behavior

---

## 6. Null Hypothesis

Proto-particles evolve independently:

- lifetimes unchanged
- cluster sizes uncorrelated
- no distance dependence

---

## 7. Failure Conditions

The interaction hypothesis is rejected if:

- interaction statistics are distance-independent
- no mergers or repulsion occur
- outcomes match independent baseline runs

---

## 8. Interpretation

This experiment does **not** assume:
- classical forces
- conserved quantities
- spacetime geometry

Any observed interaction is **emergent and statistical**.

---

## 9. Next Step

If interaction effects are confirmed:

→ derive effective interaction laws  
→ test scaling behavior  
→ attempt coarse-grained dynamics

Otherwise:

→ conclude proto-particles are inert aggregates

Both outcomes are valid.
