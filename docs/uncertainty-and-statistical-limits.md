# Uncertainty and Statistical Limits in HCSN

## Observed Tradeoff

Simulations reveal a scaling relation: Var(p) ∝ τ^(-α)
where τ is defect lifetime.

Empirically, α ≈ 0.8–1.0.

## Interpretation

Long-lived defects exhibit:
- stable momentum
- low variance

Short-lived defects exhibit:
- fluctuating momentum
- high variance

This constitutes an uncertainty-like tradeoff.

---

## No Measurement Postulate

This uncertainty does not arise from:
- observers
- wavefunction collapse
- non-commuting operators

It arises from finite rewrite statistics.

---

## Consequences

Uncertainty is not fundamental randomness,
but a limit on persistence and predictability.

This reframes quantum uncertainty as emergent.
