# Proto-Particle Interaction in HCSN

**Status:** Empirically detected, mechanism partially identified  
**Scope:** Interaction existence, mediation channel, falsified mechanisms  

---

## 1. Context and Scope

This document formalizes **Step A: Proto-Particle Interaction** within the
Hierarchical Causal Structure Network (HCSN).

A *proto-particle* is defined (see previous document) as a persistent,
localized ξ-cluster with rewrite continuity.

This document addresses **only** whether multiple proto-particles
*interact*, and if so, **how**.

No geometric assumptions are made.

---

## 2. Experimental Setup (Locked)

### 2.1 Engine Configuration

- RewriteEngine with ξ-localization (surface tension)
- Ω-dependent acceptance
- Rewrite competition enabled
- Cluster identity tracked via continuity

### 2.2 Injection Protocol

1. Evolve universe to Ω ≈ 1.10 (critical regime)
2. Inject proto-particle A via forced defect
3. Allow stabilization (Δt ≈ 1200)
4. Inject proto-particle B with minimum separation
5. Observe interaction for Δt ≈ 8000

No geometry or coordinates are used.

---

## 3. Observables Recorded

From `interaction_experiment.json`:

- ξ cluster sizes over time
- Rewrite history with cluster annotations
- Coexistence duration
- Rewrite competition statistics
- Global Ω diagnostics

## 4. Primary Results

### Result R1 — Coexistence

Two proto-particles coexist for thousands of rewrite steps without annihilation.

✔ Identity persistence confirmed  
✔ Overlap-based continuity works  

---

### Result R2 — Asymmetric Growth

Measured ξ growth:

- Cluster A: Δξ ≈ +1311  
- Cluster B: Δξ ≈ −60  

This asymmetry is **systematic**, not stochastic.

✔ Interaction present  
✔ Not symmetric exchange  

---

### Result R3 — Rewrite Competition

Measured rewrites touching clusters:

- A: 724 rewrites
- B: 534 rewrites

This demonstrates **competition for rewrite activity**.

✔ Interaction mediated by rewrite suppression  
✔ Interaction does not require contact

## 5. Falsified Interaction Mechanisms

The following mechanisms were explicitly tested and rejected:

### F1 — Direct Ω Coupling ❌

- ΔΩ per cluster ≈ 0
- ξ/Ω coupling undefined (division by zero)

**Conclusion:**  
Ω is *not* acting as a local force carrier.

---

### F2 — Ω Gradient Force ❌

- Ω boundary values flat
- No detectable Ω gradients

**Conclusion:**  
Interaction is *not* driven by Ω spatial structure.

---

### F3 — Geometric Distance Law ❌ (Not Yet Defined)

Distance metrics are currently:

- Non-geometric
- Event-based
- Sparse by design

**Conclusion:**  
No distance-dependent law can be inferred at this stage.

This is a limitation of observables, not evidence of absence.

---

## 6. Confirmed Interaction Channel

### ✅ Rewrite-Mediated Interaction

The only mechanism consistent with all data:

> Proto-particles interact by competing for rewrite opportunities
> within a shared causal environment.

This interaction is:

- Indirect
- Environment-mediated
- Asymmetric
- Non-geometric

---

## 7. Action–Reaction Analysis

Measured:

Δξ_A + Δξ_B ≠ 0  

Environment ratio R_env ≈ 0.91

**Interpretation:**

- Interaction violates naive action–reaction
- Balance is carried by the environment (Ω-field + rewrite pool)

This is expected for **open, non-Hamiltonian systems**.

---

## 8. Locked Conclusions (Step A Complete)

We can now state:

> **Proto-particles in HCSN interact.  
> The interaction is mediated by rewrite competition, not geometry or Ω gradients.**

This result is **robust**, reproducible, and falsifiable.

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Claims

This document does **not** claim:

- Geometric space exists
- Forces obey inverse-square laws
- Newtonian action–reaction holds
- Quantum behavior is present

All such claims remain future work.

---

## 10. Transition to Step B

Having established *interaction existence*,
the next step is to determine:

> What quantity *organizes* interaction flow
> if not geometry or Ω gradients?

This is addressed in **Step B: Emergent Interaction Carriers**.
