# HCSN Core Theory  
**Hierarchical Causal Structure Networks**

This repository presents the *core theoretical framework* of HCSN — a pre-geometric, causal, discrete theory in which spacetime, particles, and fields emerge from local hierarchical rewriting of relational structures.

This repository contains:
- Ontological foundations
- Fundamental dynamics
- Emergence mechanisms
- Conceptual correspondence with known physics

⚠️ This repository contains **no simulation code**.  
All numerical evidence and experiments are maintained separately.
