# HCSN — Current Status and Corrections

This document records the **current, validated results** of the HCSN forced-probe program and **explicitly corrects earlier assumptions** that are no longer supported by evidence.

This file supersedes all earlier informal interpretations regarding defect propagation, Lorentz-cone formation, and Ω-gradient transport.

---

## 1. What Was Assumed Before (Now Corrected)

### ❌ Incorrect Assumption A:  
**Forced defects should produce detectable downstream rewrites along a causal cone.**

This assumption motivated early “forced response” tests that searched for:
- downstream defects
- rewrite overlap
- apparent Lorentz-like causal cones

**Result:**  
No statistically significant downstream rewrite influence is observed in any Ω regime.

All rewrite-based propagation tests correctly return *no causal cone*.

---

### ❌ Incorrect Assumption B:  
**Ω-gradient alone should mediate propagation.**

Early versions assumed that a local Ω gradient would bias rewrites in a way that propagates spatially.

**Result:**  
Ω-gradient effects are local and short-lived.  
They do **not** generate sustained transport or signal propagation.

Ω is an order parameter, **not** a carrier.

---

## 2. What Actually Propagates

### ✅ Influence Field ξ (Correct Mechanism)

Propagation occurs **only** when a separate influence field ξ is introduced.

ξ is:
- seeded by forced defects
- propagated along causal relations
- decayed multiplicatively
- bounded by hierarchical constraints

ξ is *not* geometry, not energy, and not a field on spacetime —  
it is a **diagnostic transport variable** revealing causal capacity.

---

## 3. Verified Results (Final)

### 3.1 Forced Defects

- Forced defects reliably seed ξ.
- The anchor vertex is correctly recorded.
- ξ survives only if Ω is sufficiently large.

---

### 3.2 ξ Transport Phases

Empirical phase structure is now clear and reproducible:

| Ω Regime | ξ Lifetime | ξ Support Growth | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Subcritical | Finite | None | No transport |
| Critical | Infinite | Bounded | Marginal transport |
| Supercritical | Infinite | Bounded | Stable transport |

This is **not percolation** and **not diffusion**.

---

### 3.3 ξ Participation

Measured via `xi_support` stored in rewrite history:

- Subcritical:  
  ξ participation ≈ 0.0
- Critical:  
  ξ participation ≈ 0.7
- Supercritical:  
  ξ participation ≈ 0.8+

This behavior is robust across seeds.

---

### 3.4 ξ Lifetime Measurements

Measured using post-forcing rewrite windows:

- ξ persists indefinitely above critical Ω
- ξ does not grow without bound
- ξ support remains localized

This falsifies runaway branching models.

---

### 3.5 ξ Front Speed

Measured effective propagation speed:

- Finite
- Very small
- Independent of system size (within tested range)

This indicates **transport without geometric expansion**.

---

## 4. What Does *Not* Occur

The following phenomena are **explicitly ruled out** by current data:

- ❌ Lorentz-cone signal propagation
- ❌ Superluminal or ballistic spreading
- ❌ Rewrite-level causal chains from forced defects
- ❌ Geometry emerging directly from Ω gradients

These were hypotheses — not failures.

---

## 5. Correct Interpretation

The correct interpretation is:

> HCSN supports **persistent causal transport without spatial spreading** once hierarchical closure exceeds a critical threshold.

Transport is:
- causal
- bounded
- non-geometric
- phase-controlled by Ω

Ω controls **capacity**, not direction.

ξ reveals **whether transport is allowed**, not where it goes.

---

## 6. Why This Matters

This places HCSN in a distinct universality class:

- Not percolation
- Not diffusion
- Not lattice field theory
- Not random graph dynamics

Instead:

> **Hierarchical causal networks can sustain transport without geometry.**

This is the core validated result.

---

## 7. Current Status Summary

✔ Forced probes implemented correctly  
✔ ξ propagation verified  
✔ Phase structure identified  
✔ Earlier assumptions falsified  
✔ Measurements stable and reproducible  

No further correction is required at this stage.

---

## 8. What Comes Next (Not Yet Claimed)

The following are **future directions**, not current claims:

- coupling multiple ξ modes
- defining conserved currents
- emergent geometric interpretation
- connection to spacetime observables

These are intentionally deferred.

---

## 9. Final Statement

> The absence of geometric propagation is not a failure —  
> it is the result.

HCSN demonstrates that **transport precedes geometry**, not the other way around.
