## Definition: Emergent Ω Field

We define Ω(x, t) as an emergent scalar observable associated with
coarse-grained causal structure.

Ω is not a fundamental degree of freedom.
It summarizes local hierarchical closure and causal reinforcement
over mesoscopic scales.

### Empirical Properties of Ω

1. Ω evolves continuously in time at coarse scales.
2. Ω responds locally to causal defects and relaxes afterward.
3. Perturbations in Ω propagate with a finite maximal speed.
4. Ω exhibits both diffusive and wave-like regimes depending on scale and stability.
