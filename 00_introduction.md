# Introduction

Modern physics assumes spacetime as a background arena in which matter and fields evolve.  
HCSN reverses this assumption.

**Hierarchical Causal Structure Networks (HCSN)** propose that:
- Causality is fundamental
- Spacetime is emergent
- Physical law is an attractor, not an axiom

The theory is motivated by three tensions in current physics:
1. The incompatibility of quantum mechanics and general relativity
2. The unexplained origin of spacetime geometry
3. The lack of a fundamental explanation for universal speed limits

HCSN addresses these by removing spacetime, metrics, and fields from the foundational level entirely.

This document presents the *core theory only*.  
Empirical validation is treated separately.
